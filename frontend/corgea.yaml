      This frontend is part of a deliberately vulnerable application designed for testing and educational purposes.
      It should pay attention to vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where user inputs are not properly sanitized,
      and potential exposure of sensitive data through improper handling of user inputs and outputs.
      Ensuring that user inputs are validated and encoded before being displayed is crucial to mitigate these risks.
