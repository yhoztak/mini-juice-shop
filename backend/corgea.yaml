      This section defines directories to exclude from security scans in the backend code.
      The 'migrations' directory is used for database schema changes and typically does not
      contain executable code, but it should be checked for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
      The 'config' directory contains configuration files that may include sensitive data
      such as credentials or API keys. It's important to ensure these files are not exposed
      to unauthorized access and are properly secured.
